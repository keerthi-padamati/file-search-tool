#  File Searcher

**File Searcher** is a fast, concurrent Java utility that searches your entire computer for files or folders by name.  
It scans all available drives in parallel using a **ForkJoinPool**, providing quick and efficient results even across large file systems.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **Multi-threaded search** using Java‚Äôs `ForkJoinPool`
-  Scans all available system drives automatically
-  Supports both **file and folder** name searches
-  Case-insensitive matching
-  Displays total search time and thread usage
-  Safe concurrent result collection using `ConcurrentLinkedQueue`

---

## üß∞ Technologies Used

- **Java 17+** (or any modern version supporting `ForkJoinPool` and NIO)
- `java.nio.file.*` for efficient filesystem traversal
- `java.util.concurrent.*` for parallel processing

---

## üß† How It Works

1. Lists all **available system drives** (e.g., `C:\`, `D:\`, etc.)
2. Prompts the user to enter a file or folder name to search.
3. Spawns multiple parallel search tasks using a **ForkJoinPool**:
   - Each task recursively scans directories.
   - Matches are collected into a **thread-safe queue** (`ConcurrentLinkedQueue`).
4. When all tasks finish, it prints:
   - All matching file/folder paths  
   - Total time taken  
   - Number of threads used
